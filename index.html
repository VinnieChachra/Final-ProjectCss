                    <p>
                        I am Vinnie Chachra, studying Computer programming at georgian college. I am from India and came here to do my diploma. I
                        was surrounded by loving parents who instilled in me the importance of family, education, and hard work. Growing up, I was 
                        surrounded by the beauty of nature, and I developed a deep love for the outdoors. I spent my days exploring the woods, 
                        playing with friends, and nurturing my curiosity about the world around me. My parents were my first teachers, and they
                        nurtured my thirst for knowledge, encouraging me to excel in my studies and pursue my passions.Education has always been a 
                        priority in my life. I attended [DPS], where I discovered my love for science and technology. I was fascinated by how the 
                        world worked, and I spent hours researching about coding and being a programmer.In addition to my academic pursuits, I also 
                        had a deep passion for music. I learned to play the guitar at a young age and spent countless hours strumming my favorite
                        tunes. Music became an outlet for me, allowing me to express my emotions and creativity. I also developed a love for 
                        photography and spent many weekends capturing the beauty of nature and the world around me through my lens. My hobbies 
                        provided me with a sense of joy, inspiration, and a creative outlet during challenging times.

                <p>My C# Hangman game is a word-guessing classic. Players try to uncover a hidden word letter by letter within a limited number of attempts. It's an entertaining and challenging project that utilizes C# programming concepts like loops and arrays to create an engaging word-based game.</p>
